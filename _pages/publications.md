## Publications

### 1) [De Novo Design of Anti-COVID Drugs Using Machine Learning-Based Equivariant Diffusion Model Targeting the Spike Protein](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/45/5/271)
Machine learning–driven diffusion model to generate candidate molecules targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The whole process was evaluvated using property screening (ADMET) and docking-based analysis.This paper was present at AIML BIO International Confernace(Dec 2022) held in Bengaluru.
