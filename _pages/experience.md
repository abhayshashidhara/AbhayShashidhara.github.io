### 1) AI and Automation Intern — [Octakaigon Bock Pvt Ltd (BOCK AI)](https://www.bockbharath.org/), Bengaluru, India

*(December 2024 – June 2025)*

During my internship at BOCK AI, I contributed to end-to-end AI workflows for clinical and medical text applications, supporting the full cycle from model experimentation to deployment-ready pipelines. My primary role was fine-tuning compact transformer models to generate diagnostic-style outputs, and improving quality through iterative evaluation and refinement. I also helped streamline the training workflow on Google Cloud Vertex AI, reducing iteration time and making it easier to update models as the dataset evolved.

In parallel, I worked with a team on an early text-to-video prototype that converted clinical instructions into short video-like visual sequences using prompt-based encoding and diffusion-driven generation, exploring how multimodal generation could support healthcare-focused applications.

### 2) Project Intern — [Center of Excellence in Computational Genomics (RVCE)](https://rvce.edu.in/department/biotechnology/centre_of_excellence_in_computational_genomics/), Bengaluru, India

*(November 2022 – December 2022)*

At the Center of Excellence for Computational Genomics (RVCE), I worked on early-stage ML research prototyping for drug discovery, focused on improving how candidate molecules can be generated and screened. I explored generative modeling approaches (DDPM) to propose new molecules for COVID-related targets, and used constraint-guided refinement to steer outputs toward chemically valid structures. I then prioritized candidates using ADMET-based feature screening to estimate drug-likeness and early safety signals, helping connect model outputs to practical downstream evaluation steps used in real discovery workflows.

I also had the opportunity to present this work at the [AIML BIO International Conference (RVCE, December 2022)](https://www.bangalorenewsnetwork.com/news_detail.php?f_news_id=2377).
