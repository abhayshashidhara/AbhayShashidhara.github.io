      <ul class="xp-bullets">
        <li>Collected and processed domain-specific medical content from clinical textbooks and public health sources, converting raw material into structured JSON suitable for model training.</li>
        <li>Fine-tuned DistilGPT-2 to generate symptom-conditioned diagnostic text aligned with the curated medical dataset.</li>
        <li>Built and deployed a scalable fine-tuning pipeline on Google Cloud Vertex AI to support iterative updates on evolving medical datasets.</li>
        <li>Developed an early prototype for text-to-video generation using transformer-based prompt encoding and diffusion-based video synthesis to convert clinical instructions into visual sequences.</li>

      <p class="xp-summary">
        At the Center of Excellence for Computational Genomics, I focused on generative modeling for molecular discovery, applying diffusion-based methods and constraint-driven refinement to improve candidate compound quality.
      </p>

      <ul class="xp-bullets">
        <li>Implemented an equivariant diffusion model (DDPM) for de novo molecular generation using noise scheduling and reverse diffusion.</li>
        <li>Applied conditional and inpainting strategies to enforce molecular constraints and refine ligand–pocket interactions for improved docking behavior.</li>
        <li>Performed ADMET property screening using SwissADME and ProTox-II to validate drug-likeness and safety profiles of generated compounds.</li>
