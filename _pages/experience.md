### 1) AI and Automation Intern — [Octakaigon Bock Pvt Ltd (BOCK AI)](https://www.bockbharath.org/), Bengaluru, India

*(December 2024 – June 2025)*

During my internship at BOCK AI, I worked on end to end AI workflows for clinical and medical text use cases, from model experimentation to deployment ready pipelines. My core contribution was fine tuning compact transformer models including DistilGPT 2 to generate symptom conditioned diagnostic style text, and supporting iterative improvement through evaluation and refinement cycles. I also contributed to the training workflow on Google Cloud Vertex AI to shorten iteration time and make updates easier as the dataset evolved. 

In parallel, I collaborated with a team on an early prototype that transformed clinical instructions into short visual sequences using prompt based encoding and diffusion driven generation, to evaluate how multimodal generation could support healthcare focused applications.

### 2) Project Intern — [Center of Excellence in Computational Genomics (RVCE)](https://rvce.edu.in/department/biotechnology/centre_of_excellence_in_computational_genomics/), Bengaluru, India

*(November 2022 – December 2022)*

At the Center of Excellence for Computational Genomics (RVCE), I worked on early-stage research prototyping to understand how machine learning can support drug discovery, especially in the screening and prioritization of candidate molecules. I explored diffusion-based molecular generation and constraint-guided refinement to propose chemically plausible candidates, then evaluated them using ADMET-driven property screening to assess drug-likeness and early safety signals. This work was carried out with a focus on COVID-related targets, helping connect model outputs with practical considerations in real-world discovery workflows.

I also had the opportunity to present this work at the [AIML BIO International Conference (RVCE, December 2022)](https://www.bangalorenewsnetwork.com/news_detail.php?f_news_id=2377).
