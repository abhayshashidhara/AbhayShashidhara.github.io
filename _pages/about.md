I am a Master’s student in Data Science at the [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience), with an academic background in Biotechnology Engineering from [RV College of Engineering](https://rvce.edu.in/departments/biotechnology/department_of_biotechnology) and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence from the [Indian Institute of Technology Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/). My transition into data science was driven by a strong interest in applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to complex real world problems, particularly in healthcare and life sciences.

Through my coursework, research projects, and industry internship experience, I have gained hands on experience building machine learning systems end to end. My work focuses on data preparation, model development, fine tuning of LLMs, and deployment with an emphasis on practical use cases. I have worked with transformer based models and diffusion models, mainly in projects involving healthcare and biological data.

I am particularly interested in Generative AI, Natural Language Processing, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and image processing, with a strong inclination toward applying these methods in interdisciplinary problem spaces. I am currently open to roles in data science and machine learning engineering, and I welcome conversations around projects, collaborations, and professional opportunities.
